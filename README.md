# Ashley's LEAP Content Production Editing Notes

### Tues May 3rd 2016
_Began at about 11:45 AM PST._

# Project setup

- Received Dropbox folder invitation from Alex with Slides and Audio;
    + `\Audio\LEAP - Session 2-5.aiff`
    + `\Audio\LEP - Lesson 2-6 Edited.aiff`
    + `\Audio\LEP - Lesson 2-7 Edited.aiff`
    + `\Slides\LEAP - Lesson 5.key`
    + `\Slides\LEAP - Lesson 6.key`
    + `\Slides\LEAP - Lesson 7.key`
    + `\Slides\LEAP - Lesson 8.key`
    + `\Slides\LEP - Lesson 5.key`
    + `\Slides\LEP - Lesson 6.key`
    + `\Slides\LEP - Lesson 7.key`
    + `\Slides\LEP - Lesson 9.key`
- First impression; files are confusingly named, had to clarify with Alex that "LEAP" versions of Slides are most up-to-date, still missing Alex' Lesson 9 updated Keynote deck, don't yet have Hussein's Lesson 8 or Lesson 9 audio files. (Not aligned with Alex' self-impoosed deadlines from our contract.)

# Lesson 5 preliminary edit

- Reviewed `\Slides\LEAP - Lesson 5.key` – found 15-20 slides with lots of text on them (30-60 words per slide) and reached out to Alex on Slack, apparently he's OK with this early-stage version; mentioned that the edit might go faster becasuse of having fewer edits to align etc.
- Connected 120GB USB HDD and 240GB Thunderbolt SSD, began copying `~ Completed Edited, Master Files, and Uploads` from SSD to HDD as backup of "finished" content on SSD.
- Opened up FCPX, reviewed project files and assets.
- Reviewed filenames on SSD as well; Created new folder called `May 2016 - LEAP Lesson 5` for the new Lesson 5 edit; renamed previous folders (for Lesson 1 through 4) as `Early - LEAP Lesson 1` and so on.
- Tidied and organized files and folders on SSD; now all exported slide decks are in `exported deck` subfolders.
- Opened `SSD\May 2016 - LEAP Lesson 5\`, renamed `LEAP - Session 2-5.aiff` to `LEAP - Lesson 2.aiff`.
- Opened `LEAP - Lesson 5.key` in Keynote; total of 64 slides.
- Exported Lesson 5 keynote deck to `.\exported deck\` with these settings:

![Keynote export settings](./img/keynote-export-settings.png)

- Export completed: 64 slides total.
- Renamed previous Projects in FCPX library as `Early - x` where `x` is the previous (early 2016) project name.
-  Created a new Project called `May 2016 - L05` for the (whole Episode 5) edit, see here:

![FCPX updated project list as of May 3rd](./img/updated-project-list-may-3rd.png)

- Began edit by importing `exported deck` images and `LEAP - Lesson 5.aiff` audio file.
- Dragged audio file to timeline as timing anchor; I have assumed that this is the master "pace" of the edit.
- Copied (Early Lesson 5) intro video (from boardroom / Hussein on camera introducing the Lesson) into new Lesson 5 project timeline.

### Edited/assembled Lesson 5 preliminary edit. Runtime 19m50s.

![Lesson 05 preliminary edit screenshot](./img/lesson05-preliminary-edit.png)

- Some sections of Hussein's audio don't yet have accompanying slides, have left them blank for now; will follow up with Alex on these missing slides (or ask to make decisions about removing Hussein's additional content, etc) once the preview is available for his review.
- Rendered 540p preview copy of entire Lesson 5 edit via Compressor, shared in [#lep_content](https://launchacademy.slack.com/messages/lep_content/) channel on the [Launch Academy Slack](http://launchacademy.slack.com/) board. (Will take a while to upload the ~238MB video file.)
- Consolidated preview video into project folder on SSD.

_Went off the clock at about 1:25 PM PST._

_Resumed working on project at about 7:45 PM PST._

# Lesson 6 early edit

- Duplicated `May 2016 - L05` and renamed to `May 2016 - L06` in FCPX.
- Cleared out duplicated timeline, other than introductory slide.
- Opened `SSD\` to create `May 2016 - LEAP Lesson 6\` folder and copy in assets from Dropbox shared folder.
- Copied in files, renamed to convention established with Lesosn 5 folder / file setup.
- Opened Lesson 6 keynote file to review deck; 53 frames total.
- Exported all keynote slides to `exported deck` folder to follow convention; resulted in 53 frames total output.
- As before, dragged Hussein's audio file into FCPX project space and onto L06 timeline, assuming this is the "master" pace of the edit.
- Added in L05 intro content (front boardroom / Hussein on camera.)

### Edited/assembled Lesson 6 preliminary edit. Runtime: 21m12s.

![Lesson 06 preliminary edit screenshot](./img/lesson06-preliminary-edit.png)

- A few missing slides and extra audio; massive production value-adds available through mini animations, edits, pacing, etc.
- Rendered 540p preview copy of entire Lesson 6 edit via Compressor, shared in [#lep_content](https://launchacademy.slack.com/messages/lep_content/) channel on the [Launch Academy Slack](http://launchacademy.slack.com/) board. (Will take a while to upload the ~279MB video file.)
- Consolidated preview video into project folder on SSD.
- Alex updated the Lesson 5 and Lesson 6 keynote decks in Dropbox; will have to update him on the workflow for integrating those changes.

![Lesson 07 preliminary edit screenshot](./img/lesson07-preliminary-edit.png)

# Lesson 5-6-7 edit updates

- Caught up on Alex' feedback notes via Slack:

```
----- May 4th -----
alexchuang72 [5:01] 
so I just finished reviewing lesson 5, looks great so far

[5:02] 
for the black screens, i would just use the previous slide

[5:02] 
don’t think they would need additional verbose slides

[5:06] 
oh it seems like session 5 intro was used for session 6


----- May 5th -----
alexchuang72 [2:47 PM] 
session 6 looks good as well besides the intro part

[2:47] 
please use previous slides for the black screens

alexchuang72 [9:02 PM] 
just reviewed lesson 7

[9:04] 
can we start the“What is a MVP” slide at 1:15

[9:04] 
and i think we’ll need to add additional recording from Hussein to talk about the homework at the end

[9:05] 
but everything else looks good!
